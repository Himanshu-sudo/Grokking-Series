# Doing your Homework

In this lesson, we'll learn why researching an organization before an interview is important and some concrete steps you can take to do that.

## Why research an organization? [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/YVl2P358oJ9#why-research-an-organization)

You must always remember that interviews are ***biologically stressful situations***. I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt get stressed? You are given x amount of minutes to prove to someone, who you do not know, that you are exactly the type of person they need. Terrifying, but that‚Äôs why you do your homework. You wouldn‚Äôt expect to pass the technical portion of an interview without having studied in advance, so why would you think that you could pass the behavioral part without studying? No matter how personable you are, it is crucial that you **research** the organization, **study** the values that the organization rests their laurels on, and **practice** how you‚Äôre going to respond.

> ‚ÄúDuring aversive situations in which an active coping response is not available, mammals may engage in a vigilance response that involves sympathetic nervous system (SNS) arousal accompanied by an active inhibition of movement and shunting of blood away from the periphery.‚Äù- [Schneiderman, Ironson, Siegle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568977/)

## Researching the organization [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/YVl2P358oJ9#researching-the-organization)

Most of the research you need for an interview can be done by reviewing the organization‚Äôs website. This is the bare minimum for interviews; however, if you want to go further, it can be helpful to look at an organization‚Äôs social media accounts, the organization or interviewers‚Äô LinkedIn profiles, and any recent org activity in the news. While researching, look for information on the industry, competitors, market share, products and services, and brand. But why is it important to do this kind of research?

> *If this organization is a non-profit, some of these aspects will not be relevant.*

### Reviewing the website [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/YVl2P358oJ9#reviewing-the-website)

It is extremely important to look at the organization‚Äôs website before walking into an interview. Information like the organization‚Äôs mission statement, history, products, services, management, and culture will all be present on their website. Make sure that you pay special attention to the tone of what is present on the website as well as the word choice; it will give you a good idea of how the organization communicates and how productive you would be in such a setting.

Reviewing social media

The easiest way to make sure that your personality would fit within an organization is to look at their social media. How their social media (Twitter, facebook, Instagram, etc.) is managed will tell you a lot about how the organization is managed. Does their social media voice mimic the voice present on their website? Do they post a lot or is the whole thing very sparse and dry? Keep these questions in mind as you search; remember, it is not just about them liking you, it is also about you liking the organization!

Reviewing LinkedIn

LinkedIn is the easiest way to find a basis for rapport with your interviewer. Before being interviewed, check the organization‚Äôs and the interviewers‚Äô LinkedIn. While on their pages, look for shared connections and interests. These can become great points of conversation and it can be a lot easier to relax after you have engaged in easy conversation. If you don‚Äôt find anything in common, you can still comment on what they‚Äôve shared or ask a question about their career path.

Reviewing the news

The more you know about an organization, the better you will be able to tailor your responses to them. When you are up to date on organization activity, you will stand out as an **invested** potential employee.

No matter how much research you do beforehand, every little bit will help your responses to be applicable. It will also help you as you begin to plan which experiences and past successes or failures you want to highlight at the time of the interview. Don‚Äôt know what to look for? Try:

- Product announcements
- Changes in senior leadership
- Shifts from private to public
- Research breakthroughs

### Reviewing the job description [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/YVl2P358oJ9#reviewing-the-job-description)

Understanding the job description will help you to prepare for the interview and practice what you are going to say. Does the role require you to be self-directed and work autonomously? Does the role require teamwork? Is it a leadership position? If so, you will want to be ready to discuss your experience holding peers accountable and motivating a team. If the role does not require any of these aspects, be ready to discuss relevant experiences that will highlight you as someone who works hard and learns from their mistakes.

> **Pro tip:** Keep in mind that the job description may or may not accurately represent the role. Sometimes, the interviewers may not be familiar with the details of the posted job description, or the actual role may differ in meaningful ways. This being said, as the interviewee, you **must** be familiar with the job posting.

Try your hand at researching an organization with the interactive exercise in the next lesson!



# Exercise: List Organization Values

In this lesson, you'll be guided through researching an organization of your choice.

Go ahead, research the organization! Keep track of your findings, you will need to refer to them later in the practice sections of this course.

## Questions to ask yourself [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/B6jy9p428vN#questions-to-ask-yourself)

- What industry does the organization operate in?
- Who are the competitors?
- What share of the market do they have?
- What are the aspects of their brand? Do they have a logo? Colors? Tagline(s)?
- What is their mission and values?
- What are the most important products and services?
- What do customers say?
- Is this an old industry or new industry?
- What is the size of the industry with respect to the national or global economy?
- Does the organization compete on price or quality?
- How do they differentiate their products or services?

> üìù **Note:** Interviewers will listen for the words used in organizations‚Äô values statements in your answers. Refer to this list as you practice answers to behavioral questions. If the organization‚Äôs values are consistent with your own, your answers are more likely to reflect that. If the organization‚Äôs values are inconsistent with your own, this may be a sign that their culture is not right for you.

## Extra practice [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/B6jy9p428vN#extra-practice)

Review the [Starbucks Company values](https://www.starbucks.com/careers/working-at-starbucks/culture-and-values) listed below.

### Our Values [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/B6jy9p428vN#our-values)

With our partners, our coffee, and our customers at our core, we live these values:

- Creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome.
- Delivering our very best in all we do, holding ourselves accountable for results.
- Acting with courage, challenging the status quo and finding new ways to grow our company and each other.
- Being present, connecting with transparency, dignity, and respect.

We are performance-driven, through the lens of humanity.

In the next lesson, we‚Äôll go through another guided exercise that will help you fine tune how you present your experiences.

# Exercise: Create a List of Experiences

In this lesson, brainstorm a list of examples that you will use to construct answers.

Now it‚Äôs time to think of stories from your own life that you can develop into rich and meaningful responses to behavioral questions.

What experiences do you know that you absolutely want to share? Imagine a movie is being made about your life and you get to choose the scenes that show you in the best possible light. What would you choose?

When you run out of ideas, use the prompts below to help you remember more examples. Consider:

- Times when you felt a huge sense of accomplishment or success.
- Times when you fixed something that wasn‚Äôt working.
- A time when you had to make a challenging decision.
- A time when you had to influence a leader or team.
- Times when you got surprised by something or had overlooked something.
- Times when you removed barriers or came up with a creative solution.
- A time when you failed but learned.
- A time when you had to defuse an escalating situation.

We‚Äôll learn a technique to better structure your responses next!

# The STAR Technique

In this lesson, we'll learn the STAR technique.

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVQOqYYjgR3#introduction)

The STAR technique is a structured way of responding to behavioral questions in an interview. If you explain each experience with this technique, you will be able to communicate your skills in a fully fleshed out way that will help the interviewer learn about you.

**Situation**. Describe a specific situation. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances.

**Task**. What were you asked or expected to do and why? What was driving you (and/or your team) to complete this project or solve this problem? What were your responsibilities in that situation?

**Action**. Describe the actions taken. You should prioritize what you did, what your contribution was, and how those things were impactful. Focus on ‚ÄúI," not ‚Äúwe‚Äù.

**Result**. Describe the outcome. DO NOT undercut your role in the situation, this is not the time to be modest. When talking about the result, make sure you go over what happened, how the event ended, what was accomplished, and what you learned. Be positive. Even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, it is important that something positive came from it. Remember, even when things are negative (or not what you had hoped) good things can still come from them. Oftentimes, individuals have to be prompted in this section of their answer; stand out by including this part on your own.

> üìù **Note:** It is important to remember that you are describing work situations that your interviewer could probably imagine. Don‚Äôt include irrelevant details; if you do, you may lose the interest of your interviewer.

## Sample STAR Response [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVQOqYYjgR3#sample-star-response)

Sample Star Response: ‚ÄúTell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?‚Äù

**S:** There was a team member in a project I was managing whose pace was lagging behind the others.

**T:** We were in the hyper-growth phase of a company project, so each member had to do research and produce a certain amount of content per week. The goal was to create 50 internet articles per month in order to bring more traffic to the platform.

**A:** We got together to address the issue. I explained that although he was falling behind, he could still improve by making a few adjustments to his strategy. I also encouraged him to collaborate with other members if he was struggling with something.

**R:** His productivity increased and he felt more confident in his work which led to the team meeting the monthly quota, and to him producing some great ideas.

**Remember:** If you answer and the interviewer asks about another detail, please don‚Äôt panic. That is a *good sign*. You want the interviewer to clarify, it means that they‚Äôre listening and the example was relevant.

# Excercise: STAR Technique

Let's dissect an answer that uses the STAR technique!

## Practice [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7nXPEA26jWr#practice)

Which of the four parts of STAR is missing from this answer and how does this missing part negatively affect the answer‚Äôs overall strength?

**Question:** Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?

**Answer:** During my junior and senior years of college, I worked at a Pok√© place that was run by a couple. I worked as a dishwasher, chopper, custodian, and general cleaner. The store was very small, so the three of us were the only ones working. One especially busy day, I was tasked with making a Pok√© bowl for a customer. Making a Pok√© bowl is super simple, but today was very busy and making a bowl (on top of my other responsibilities) made things quite stressful. Since I was so busy, I rushed with making the bowl and finished it quickly. When I was walking back to the kitchen, however, I hit the bowl and it flew onto the ground. The bowl was ruined and I had to remake the bowl.

> The act of remaking the bowl *seems* like it satisfies the ‚Äúresult‚Äù section of STAR, but does it really? A better ‚Äúresult‚Äù might be what you would do differently in the future.

Now that you have spent time preparing, let‚Äôs gain some insight from other disciplines.

# Borrowing from other disciplines

In writing this course, we reviewed advice and materials from the legal profession. Believe it or not, many of the techniques used to prepare witnesses to testify at trial apply to effective interviewing.

## Answer the question that was asked [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/gknVNXq8Aor#answer-the-question-that-was-asked)

The person interviewing you has a job to do. It is their responsibility to assess your fit for the organization in the time allowed. They may have specific questions they need to ask or specific characteristics to assess. They have an agenda and it‚Äôs best to let them lead.

If a candidate takes too much time answering, elaborates in ways that aren‚Äôt helpful, or gives a response that isn‚Äôt related to the question, it interferes with the interviewer‚Äôs plan. The interviewer may become concerned about managing time or annoyed that they aren‚Äôt getting the input they need.

Be concise first and elaborate later if asked to say more. Witnesses are told to be sure they understand the question being asked, and then give the shortest truthful answer they can give. They are trained to listen all the way to the end of the question before beginning a response. Doing this will help you avoid jumping in with an answer to the question you thought they were asking, and being wrong.

Answer the question that was asked and only the question that was asked. The interviewer may have a logical series of questions planned. A response that moves in a tangent can interfere with assessing what really matters. Don‚Äôt keep talking because you have other things that you think will make you sound good. Answer the question that was asked.

The testimony of a witness should be factual, without exaggeration or hyperbole. This applies to candidates too! Using simple language and avoiding jargon will serve you and your listener best. ‚ÄúBlowing them away‚Äù with acronyms and technical lingo can backfire. The interviewer wants you to demonstrate that you can talk to any team member in the organization, not just those with specialized expertise.

> **Pro Tip**: Practice explaining your experiences, without acronyms and jargon, to someone outside your field and be sure they understand.

## Get confirmation [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/gknVNXq8Aor#get-confirmation)

If you are unsure of the question, ask for it to be repeated. You might also say:

- I‚Äôm not following the question, can you ask it in another way?
- Can you tell me a bit more about what you want?
- Do you mean‚Ä¶‚Ä¶?

You can also begin your response and ask for confirmation that your response is what they had in mind.

- I can give you an example of a time I missed a deadline, is that what you‚Äôre asking?
- I can tell you about my experience leading a remote team, is that a good example?

The interviewer will likely give you more guidance if you are missing the mark.

Don‚Äôt talk over someone in the interview. If an interviewer or panelist starts talking during your response, stop talking for a moment. They are likely trying to give guidance or manage expectations. Before you resume, ask, ‚Äúshall I continue?‚Äù

## Avoid talking in absolutes [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/gknVNXq8Aor#avoid-talking-in-absolutes)

Witnesses are advised to avoid saying things like ‚Äúnever‚Äù or ‚Äúalways‚Äù. Such phrases are too precise and can trigger skepticism. Instead, express your preferences, intentions, and actions in a natural way that gives you some room for things out of your control. Here are some ideas:

- I‚Äôm always on time ‚Üí I prefer being on time whenever possible.
- I‚Äôm never insensitive ‚Üí I work hard to give feedback in a constructive way that considers personal feelings.
- That‚Äôs everything that happened ‚Üí Those are the examples I can recall right now.

## Control the pace [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/gknVNXq8Aor#control-the-pace)

Witnesses are encouraged to take their time if they feel like the questions are coming too fast. They are told they can slow the pace by taking a sip of water, adjusting their glasses, shifting their posture, taking a deep breath, or asking for the question to be repeated. In an interview, you can use these techniques to set a consistent pace for questions and responses. You don‚Äôt have to wait until you need a moment. You can take a moment each time. This shows confidence and sets a relaxed and natural conversational pace.

## Why we use video [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/gknVNXq8Aor#why-we-use-video)

Video is used for witness preparation and many other types of professional speaking development. Video is the fastest cure for distracting tics. Most people have them, but few are aware of them. For example, you might fidget, bite your nails, play with a ring on your finger, or repeatedly touch your face. You might string together thoughts with phrases like, ‚Äúyou know‚Äù, ‚Äúok‚Äù, or ‚Äúlike‚Äù. These are unconscious and a reaction to the stress of being scrutinized. You are probably unaware of these or assume that they will go away when you answer ‚Äúfor real‚Äù in an interview.

The intention of this course is to help you spot tics and remedy them. One of the most effective mechanisms is video. In the coming sections there will be opportunities for you use video while you practice. We encourage you to replay these recorded practice sessions. You will be astonished how quickly you correct distracting behaviors.

------

Now that you have more insight, let‚Äôs look at how you can use an interview opportunity to observe an organization‚Äôs culture.

# Be a Cultural Anthropologist

In this lesson, we will walk through how you can borrow from anthropology to study organizational culture.

## What is cultural anthropology? [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xo80X4GwYLP#what-is-cultural-anthropology)

Cultural anthropology is the study of human cultures. A cultural anthropologist may visit or live with people in a different culture to learn all about that culture from the inside. Similarities and differences between cultures can be compared and studied. When you‚Äôre interviewing with several organizations, you have a chance to do this as well (if only for an hour or two at a time).

Anthropologists study the artifacts, languages, tools, rituals, traditions, and behaviors of a culture. You have an opportunity to do this when you interview. Think of yourself as a scientist and collect data for later comparison and examination.

## Artifacts [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xo80X4GwYLP#artifacts)

Artifacts can include posters on walls, team or company apparel, prototypes, products, documentation, office configurations, badges, etc.

- ***What does it say about a culture if you see several people wearing the organization‚Äôs t-shirt?***
- ***What can you interpret from people gathered in impromptu meetings around a whiteboard?***
- ***Is the kitchen a hangout place?***

## Rituals [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xo80X4GwYLP#rituals)

Rituals can include daily standup meetings, all-hands meetings, product launches, sales or training sessions, celebrations of successes, support processes, etc. You can gain a lot of information about rituals from questions that are asked, responses that you hear, and other simple observations.

> While observing, constantly ask yourself, ***"Do these activities seem like something I would want to do?"***

## Traditions [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xo80X4GwYLP#traditions)

Traditions may involve bigger celebrations like key milestones or annual shareholder meetings. They may include volunteer activities or community engagement that shows the organization giving back.

> If you learn about some of the traditions of the organization ask yourself, ***"Do they reinforce positive aspects of the culture?" "Would I want to participate in these traditions?"***

## Language and lingo [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xo80X4GwYLP#language-and-lingo)

We have discussed the importance of the language and lingo of an organization in preparing your responses to questions. For your study of the culture, notice the formality of conversations and think about whether it fits with your professional approach at work. All organizations use acronyms, but do they explain them to a newcomer? How might this impact onboarding? If you accept an offer, do you want to be someone who talks like they do?

## Behaviors [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xo80X4GwYLP#behaviors)

What other behaviors do you notice? Do people greet each other by name as you‚Äôre being escorted around the office? Are you introduced to others? Is there joking and laughter, or a quiet tone for deep concentration? What is the energy like?

If you think of yourself as a cultural anthropologist and collect data during interviews, you will be better equipped to make a choice about a job offer or choose between many!

------

That‚Äôs it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will learn the patterns for behavioral questions.
