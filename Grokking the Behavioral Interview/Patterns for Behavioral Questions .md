# Recognizing Behavioral Interview Questions

In this lesson, we'll look at some common patterns that can help you spot a behavioral question!

## Spotting a behavioral question [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xo8w4prlYyJ#spotting-a-behavioral-question)

How will you recognize behavioral questions? Behavioral interview questions will be asked in a few different ways, but they are all intended to prompt you into describing your behavior. Listen for the following openings:

- Tell me about a time when…
- Can you share a situation when…
- What do you do when…
- Give me an example of…
- Describe a…

When you hear any of these openings, you’ll know what kind of response the interviewer is looking for.

Common hangups

Behavioral questions can sometimes include additional words that cause interviewees to hesitate. Some such words are:

**“Greatest”, “proudest”, “worst”, “best”, “biggest”, “most significant”, “fastest”**

These descriptive words could cause a candidate to pause and think back, “was this example really the worst, best, or biggest?” Instead of panicking, listen *past* these descriptors and make sure that you hear what the interviewer actually wants. Once you understand the question, respond with an applicable, practiced answer. If the situation you choose isn’t the “biggest” or the “worst”, you can introduce your answer by saying something like; “this failure wasn’t the biggest in terms of loss of business, but it had a significant impact on me because it revealed a blind spot.”

## Small talk [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xo8w4prlYyJ#small-talk)

Your interviewer may begin or end your interview with questions to put you at ease as a way to get to know you more naturally. These questions may come up when you’re walking from one interviewer to another or waiting for another participant to join a video conference. Such questions aren’t meant to trick you, but they do contribute to an interviewer’s overall impression of you. They may be looking for something that you have in common, something that makes you stand out, or just a way to get you off-script.

Be ready with genuine answers to questions like these:

- What do you like to do in your free time?
- What book are you reading right now?
- Seen any good movies lately?
- Are you a sports fan?
- Do you have any exciting trips planned?

------

Now that you know how to spot a behavioral question, let’s go over three different types of behavioral questions in the upcoming lessons!

# Prior Experience Questions

In this lesson, we'll learn what prior experience questions are looking for and how to answer them best!

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/BnEv1Jpqk9Y#introduction)

Prior experience questions are intended to prompt you into sharing examples from your life. The idea behind these questions is that your past experiences are predictors of future behavior. As you answer these questions, interviewers are listening to understand your instincts and influences.

## Your life as your CV [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/BnEv1Jpqk9Y#your-life-as-your-cv)

The advantage for you (the candidate) is that this is a time to tell stories about **you**. In other words, you already know the answers to these questions.

Notice that we said you will be sharing examples from your life and **not necessarily** from previous work experiences. Most often, your examples *should be* from previous work experiences, but if you are new to your career or new to the industry, you may not have work experiences to share. In that case, you will be preparing examples from all aspects of your life.

Even if you are an experienced professional, you may choose an example from a volunteer experience or your personal life that demonstrates who you are.

> **Pro Tip**: Make sure that everything you say in a response is relevant to the response. Everything that you mention should come back around, if it doesn’t, then it should not be included. For example, think of a recipe in a cookbook. The “ingredient” section only lists things that will be used to make the dish - nothing more, nothing less. Do the same for your answers.

We’ll look at a couple of prior experience answers in the next lesson!

# Parsing Prior Experience Questions

In this lesson, we'll look at a couple of prior experience questions and responses from experienced professionals.

The first response details some do’s and don’ts.

## Question #1 [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/Bnnmn5pnXv2#question-1)

Tell me about a time when you experienced failure.

## Response [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/Bnnmn5pnXv2#response)

“I was leading the implementation of new shipping and inventory management systems for 35 manufacturing plants. During our pilot plant implementation, we had major hardware failures with the scanning solution installed on forklifts. The failures were so bad that we had to resort to manual processes to keep the business going. This required us to double our staffing during the pilot. I delayed further rollouts by 8 weeks to solve the hardware problems, increasing costs. The failures during the pilot created concerns with our stakeholders that we had to overcome.”

**Take a look at this answer again. Did you notice how many times “we” was used versus “I”? Now, let’s take a look at another version of the same response.**

## Alternate response [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/Bnnmn5pnXv2#alternate-response)

" I learned how important it is to take responsibility for a failure as the leader of a team. By taking responsibility, acknowledging the problems, and committing to solutions, I was able to keep the support of the plant leadership. I also remembered that a few of the team members had asked me before the launch about doing more hardware testing and I had dismissed their concerns. I apologized to them and promised to do better going forward. My personal takeaway was to be a better listener and give full consideration to concerns that are brought to my attention."

**How does this version of the answer read in comparison? Sounds more autonomous, right? When you’re doing the practice activities in this module, assess your use of “I” and “We” in your responses.**

Let’s look at a list of real prior experience questions in the next lesson.

# Sample Prior Experience Questions

In this lesson, we'll look in-depth at some prior experience questions.

## Sample questions [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/3YEL9VZwkrr#sample-questions)

Prior experience questions come in all shapes and sizes. We have crafted some example ones (below) for you to try your hand at. Go ahead and answer them aloud!

- What was the last project you led, and what was its outcome?
- Give me an example of a time that you felt you went above and beyond at work.
- Describe a time when your work was criticized, how you responded, and what happened as a result.
- Have you ever been on a team where someone was not doing their part? How did you handle it?
- Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?
- How do you handle working with people who annoy you?
- What was the most difficult period in your life, and how did you deal with it?

- Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?
- Tell me about a time when you had to deal with conflict on the job.
- What assignment was too difficult for you, and how did you resolve the issue?
- Give me an example of a difficult decision you had to make. How did you come to that decision?
- Give an example of an idea you implemented.
- Describe a mentor who has impacted you in a positive way.
- Was there a person in your career who really made a difference? In what way?
- Tell me about your proudest achievement.

## Sample answers [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/3YEL9VZwkrr#sample-answers)

**Q:** “When things go wrong, how do you deal with it? Give me an example of a situation you dealt with in a previous role.”

> I was working as an App Developer for XYZ Company when a Zero-Day Privilege Elevation vulnerability was discovered. Microsoft issued a patch and we had 6000 Windows servers running in 4 different data centers that all needed to be patched as quickly and efficiently as possible (**Situation**). It wasn’t my job to patch servers, but the VP asked all of us for ideas to get the work done faster (**Tasks**). I suggested that several of us could help do validation if the procedure was documented. Others could help with tracking the servers coming in and out of rotation and updating tickets. This freed up the Systems Engineers to do the work that only they could do (**Actions**). I had never done some of those tasks before, so I had to follow procedures exactly and ask for help if I wasn’t sure about something. I was willing to take directions and learn. I took good notes and helped make the documentation easier to follow (**Results**). I gained a new appreciation for the Systems and Security Engineers. We worked long hours, but it felt good to pull together. It was also good to know that we could do that again if a serious security issue came up.

Be ready for possible follow up questions:

- How did you manage separation of duties?
- How long did it take overall?

Try your hand at perfecting your prior experience responses in the next lesson!

# Exercise: Answering Prior Experience Questions

In this lesson, you will practice using "I" over "we" to help you craft perfect responses to prior experience questions in a real interview!

## “We” to “I” Exercise [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7DgJ8o0N81y#we-to-i-exercise)

Practice highlighting your contributions with this exercise. Restate each sentence to remove all “we” language.

1. We found a bug in our interface and it took us all night to fix.
2. We took one look at the final product and immediately knew that it was not what the customer had requested.
3. My 4th grade teacher always wanted us to be five minutes early, and now none of us can be late.

We’ll look at what hypothetical questions might look like and how to best tackle them in the next lesson!

# Practice: Answering Prior Experience Questions

The intent of this exercise is to practice recalling applicable examples in response to questions.

Use this exercise as a way to simply practice recalling stories or examples that are appropriate for each question.

Choose as many questions as you would like and answer them with the video widget below. Remember, you can come back to this practice at any time. It’s always good to refresh!

In the next lesson we will look at Hypothetical questions and provide some examples.

# Hypotheticals

In this lesson, we'll learn all about hypothetical questions and how to best answer them.

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVq4o5xyYBG#introduction)

Hypotheticals, or “what if” questions, challenge you to demonstrate creativity and confidence; they also allow interviewers to assess your instinctive responses. These scenarios may be realistic, fantastical, or both.

Being ready for hypothetical questions can help you get past personal bias that may affect your interview performance. For example, if you are someone who prefers realism, you may be thrown by questions that ask you to imagine unrealistic scenarios. However, if you know that hypotheticals are coming, preparing for them will ensure that you won’t be caught off guard and respond poorly.

## Parsing hypothetical questions [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVq4o5xyYBG#parsing-hypothetical-questions)

Hypothetical questions will begin with phrases like:

- “Imagine…”
- “If…”
- “Put yourself in the position of…”
- “If you could have…”
- “It’s 2050 and…”
- “You’re in charge of x,y,z and…”

> **Pro Tip**: If you are someone who loves details and accuracy, you will be tempted to ask for specifics before answering. **Resist this urge!** This is a hypothetical situation, not a real one. If you need specifics, state them as **your** assumptions. For example, “I will assume that the team is co-located,” or “I will say it’s springtime and temperatures outside are moderate.”

Let’s take a look at an example.

## Question [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVq4o5xyYBG#question)

If I were your supervisor and asked you to do something that you disagreed with, what would you do?

## Response [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVq4o5xyYBG#response)

"If my supervisor asked me to do something I disagreed with I would respectfully push back. I would ask questions about the value of the project/feature/task (etc.) and how it would benefit the greater good of users. It’s important to me that I believe in what I’m working on and if I disagree with it, I think that it’s important and appropriate to push back against my management for further explanation.” – [Dakota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakota-leroy-725bb5126/)

> **Pro Tip:** You can take advantage of hypothetical questions to highlight specific skills that you know will be beneficial to the organization (hence why it is important to do your homework!).

In the example below, you will see two different responses to the same question that highlight different talents.

## Question [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVq4o5xyYBG#question-2)

How would you design a field test for wearable devices used to track dinosaurs in Jurassic Park?

### Response 1 [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVq4o5xyYBG#response-1)

What a fun question! I would do an exhaustive pre-test to maximize the testing that can be done in a safe way. I would assemble a team that includes the animal caretakers and experts, someone from park operations and a device testing expert. I would get as much input as possible from the team I curated. I would plan to test the devices on humans first, then take the trial to the zoo to test on animals that are non-threatening. With a series of graduated testing, we could validate our processes for data collection, support, provisioning, and problem management. Lower level testing could verify device operations within humidity and temperature ranges.

This response highlights the candidate’s ability to plan and solicit advice from experts.

> **Pro Tip**: It’s OK to think out loud when you’re answering hypothetical questions. In fact, it’s better so that the interviewer can see the way your brain works.

### Response 2 [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVq4o5xyYBG#response-2)

I love this question, Jurassic Park is my favorite movie! I would gather all my friends with pets. We would plan a series of three weekly pet playdates at the city park for 2 hours each. The testing team would arrive at the park early to set up all their equipment and outfit the pets. With each weekly iteration, we would deal with problems or miscalculations that we found. Then, I would talk to my father who works at a construction company that is currently building a high-rise downtown. I would ask if we could put devices on the construction workers and some of the equipment for three straight days. The devices should be exposed to the elements as much as possible. After completing the four tests, I would gather, compare, and analyze the test results with the team.

This response highlights the candidate’s creativity and ability to succeed with limited resources. These talents would be great to highlight if you are interviewing at a small company or start-up.

## Why interviewers ask hypotheticals [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qVq4o5xyYBG#why-interviewers-ask-hypotheticals)

Interviewers ask hypothetical questions to learn more about the way you creatively think, process, and react.

Take a look at this question created by [Salifu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asktherecruiter/) who is a talent leader at GitHub. He does not answer the question, but instead, he tells you what **he** is listening for as the **interviewer**.

Q: Within a 5-minute time span, the following people come to you asking for help: A V.P. whom you do not regularly interact with, your manager, and a customer. All three say their need is urgent. How do you prioritize them?

### Motivation

When I ask this question, I’m less concerned with the candidate’s answer and more focused on their thought process. The HOWs and WHYs are the keys for me. Anecdotally, when I’ve asked this question, the majority of the candidates prioritize in the following order: V.P., manager, then the customer. Candidates rarely dig deeper to find out what the requests are. Instead, they prioritize based on titles alone.

I’m mainly looking for two things in the candidate’s response. Thought process and effective communication.

### Thought Process

Does the candidate ask for more information to make an informed decision on how to prioritize? What if the issue the V.P. is facing is the inability to connect their bluetooth speaker to their laptop so they can listen to music in their office? Is that truly more important than a customer needing help? After hearing the needs, are they able to correctly prioritize based on the information they’ve received?

### Communication

Do they show that they are they able to communicate with people at different levels? Moreover, are they able to deliver “bad” news to people at different levels? Will they let everyone know how and when they plan to address their needs?

This is my favorite question because you can go in a number of different ways depending on how the interview is going. The other added benefit is that it works with candidates at almost every level.

Let’s look at some examples of hypothetical questions next!

# Practice: Answering Hypothetical Questions

Try your hand at answering these hypothetical questions!

## Sample Questions [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/qAOlVWMWw4r#sample-questions)

We have crafted some sample questions (below) for you to try your hand at. While you work on answering these questions, it is important to remember that you should be creative as well as practical. Stretch the limits of your reality, but not the bounds. Look through the questions and then click on the video widget to get started. Once you have finished answering each question, refer to the rubric to self-assess.

- Your team is giving a presentation in two hours and one member just called in sick. What do you do?
- If you had to choose between a work environment that was always in chaos and one in which nothing ever changed, which would you choose?
- If you inherited so much money that you never had to work again, how would you spend your time?
- If you could create a fictional company to make the world a better place, what would that company do?
- Imagine that you are the product manager for a consumer device that just launched, but 20% of the devices are breaking in the first week from normal use. What do you do?
- Describe how you would handle a situation if you were required to finish multiple tasks by the end of the day, and there was no conceivable way that you could finish them.

> **Remember**: These questions may not *necessarily* follow the STAR technique because the situation is given and there are no tangible results that you can declare. Instead, restate the situation, be creative with your tasks and actions, and the results will be implied.

------

In the next lesson, we’ll look at values-based questions.

# Values-Based Questions

Let's explore what values-based questions are in this lesson.

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/m7mD9zz18Br#introduction)

Values-based questions openly examine whether or not your values are a good match with the organization’s values.

The good news is that the responses you’ve prepared for the “prior experience” questions can also work well for values-based questions. This is the time for you to refer to your list of the organization’s values from your homework.

Yes, you will want to use the organization’s lingo (can be found on their website and/or social media) in your responses as it shows an understanding of the organization and an ability to meld into their culture.

Please do not confuse this with being phony, it is not the same thing. Instead, you are simply placing your knowledge and experiences into a framework that is familiar to the interviewer.

## Example [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/m7mD9zz18Br#example)

If one of the organization’s values is, “Act like an owner,” and you are sharing a time when you were responsible for something, you can describe it by saying, “I owned…”.

If the organization’s value is, “Continuous Improvement,” and you are giving an example of a problem you solved, it might fit to say something like, “this was a one-time fix for the problem, but in order to continuously improve, we monitored the results daily to understand early indicators.”

## Sample answers [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/m7mD9zz18Br#sample-answers)

**Q:** Give me an example of an org culture where you felt like you could do your best work. What was it about the culture that allowed you to perform well?

> When I was at ABC Foundation, there was a real focus on sharing information. We worked in teams of 8-10 people, each with a Lead. Leads reported up to managers that had two or three teams. The culture was very collaborative. Everybody worked on everything, so you got to know each other’s code and areas of expertise. If you discovered a new problem or way to do something, you were expected to add it to the KB. There was less reliance on tribal knowledge than there is at other places I’ve worked. There was no pressure to act like you know everything. If you had a question, you owned the question until it was answered, and then you were responsible for documenting the answer so others would have it. It wasn’t ok to just pose a question and be stuck if nobody responded. I got better at writing code other people could follow. My documentation really improved. We debated things and tested new ideas, but it wasn’t about something being right or winning an argument. It was about finding the best way to do something, which is really satisfying to me. If I were to join your company, I would hope to foster the same behaviors.
>
> If you were an interviewer who was listening for certain values in this response, what would you hear?

Asking good questions is just as important as giving good answers! Let’s learn how to do that in the next lesson.

# Asking Questions

In this lesson, we'll look at what questions to ask in an interview.

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/B8z2ZnQ1Evk#introduction)

Every interviewer should, and probably will, ask you if you have any questions for them – ***always say yes***. Asking questions is shows that you have prepared for the interview and have an interest in the organization. Make sure that you bring your list of questions with you on a printed paper; do not expect to remember them on the spot and do not plan to look up a list on your phone. Be alert; be ready.

## A few simple rules [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/B8z2ZnQ1Evk#a-few-simple-rules)

**Rule #1:** Always have questions ready to ask the interviewer.

**Rule #2:** If, during the interview, you have developed a good rapport and natural curiosity about the interviewer or something that the interviewer said, ask **that** question instead of a prepared one.

**Rule #3:** The best method is to ask your interviewer questions that give them a chance to talk about themselves. This helps you avoid asking questions about things that you could have easily learned from their website. It also demonstrates relationship-building skills and gives you a reason to be genuine. Luckily, asking questions about another person’s experiences or opinions comes naturally in conversation – don’t overthink it, be human.

**Rule #4:** Ask open-ended questions that elicit a response beyond “yes” or “no.”

**Rule #5:** This is not the time to ask questions about compensation, hours, perks, or titles. Asking such questions could potentially plant ideas about your motivations and drivers that may work against you. Instead, ask questions that are in the same context as the behavioral interview. This is your chance to find out if the organization’s values are just marketing buzzwords or truly a part of the culture.

When NOT to ask questions

The only time you should forego the opportunity to ask a question is when you can tell that the interviewer is anxious to end the interview. Maybe the interviewer is running behind schedule and someone is waiting outside the room, or the next interviewer is waiting for their turn to meet with you. In these instances, be ready with a response like, “I have a few more questions, but I can send them to the recruiter. Thank you so much for your time.”

Ideally, you should have 4-5 questions ready. When being interviewed by more than one person sequentially, ask each interviewer a different question – they will compare the questions they were asked when they meet with each other to discuss your candidacy.

Addressing a panel

If you are being interviewed by a panel, ask the panel at least two questions. In order to increase the possibility of having a different interviewer respond to your second question, make eye contact with someone other than the interviewer who responded to your first question. This is also a subtle way for you to demonstrate your ability to foster engagement from a group.

------

In the next lesson, we’ll look at some potential questions you can ask after an interview.

# Good Questions to Ask

In this lesson, we'll go through some questions you can ask after most interviews.

## Examples [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7A4LnMOwlM1#examples)

1. What sort of tangible changes has this organization made in regards to promoting gender diversity?
2. What are the most exciting projects you’ve worked on here?
3. What do you like most about the organization?
4. What would you change about the organization?
5. How has the organization changed since you’ve joined?
6. What do you like most about working here?
7. Can you describe the organization’s overall management style and the type of person who usually does well here?
8. What excites you the most about the organization’s future?
9. If you could change one thing about the organization, what would it be?
10. Does the organization have any traditions or rituals that you like?
11. Where do you see the organization in three years and how would I contribute to that if I’m hired for this role?
12. What is a challenge the organization is facing right now and how could I contribute to overcoming it?
13. In what ways might this role change in the next year?
14. What would the onboarding process be like for this role?
15. What can you tell me about the position that isn’t in the job description?
16. Do you expect to do more hiring in this group in the next six months?
17. What surprised you about the organization after you started working here?
18. What has allowed you to be successful here?
19. How does the organization respond to failure?
20. Tell me about your most successful employees. What do they do that really sets them apart?
21. What haven’t I asked about that most candidates want to know?
22. If you were interviewing with your organization again, what questions would you be asking?
23. (If this is your future boss) How would you describe your management style?
24. What’s your timeline for the next steps?
25. Are there resources I could review in advance to get a head start on the learning curve?

------

If you are looking for a **bolder** conversational point, give this a try:

**Is there anything about my background or resume that makes you question whether or not I am a good fit for this role?**

This question displays that you’re very interested in the job and committed to understanding your prospects as a candidate. Plus, it will allow you an opportunity to respond to any potential concerns.

------

Let’s take a quiz in the next lesson!

# Quiz: Test yourself

Check your understanding with the quiz questions below!

> Choose the most thorough answer for the question, “Describe a mentor who has impacted you in a positive way.”
>
> My advisor in college was very supportive of me. She placed me in positions where I would succeed. Even when I didn’t know it, my advisor was always looking for ways that she could help me build my resume. Whenever my advisor sent an opportunity my way, I would take it and try to make the best out of it. Since I knew that her career had been very similar to what I wanted to go into, I fully trusted her and the opportunities that she brought to the table. With the help of my advisor’s recommendations, I was able to secure a good job right out of college. Even though I had only just graduated, I left college with a full resume that made me marketable and brought me to a great, full-time position.

> Which of the following questions would be best to ask your interviewer?
>
> How has this organization changed since you joined?
