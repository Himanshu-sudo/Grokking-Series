# Why Prepare?

Welcome to the course! Let's start off by looking at some reasons why you would want to be prepared.

## Interviews can be stressful! [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/N0WMEjEQqYN#interviews-can-be-stressful)

Many job seekers underestimate the need to prepare for behavioral interviews. They assume it will be easy to talk about themselves and their experiences in a way that comes naturally without studying or refreshing beforehand. However, what you need to remember is that interviews can be stressful and stress produces negative side-effects like sweating, awkward body movements, and blank minds.

In such situations, our brains spend valuable processing time on keeping us calm and appearing professional, which means that there is less brain capacity for retrieving memories and stringing words together in an intelligent way.

Without enough preparation, candidates may end up rambling or sharing incoherent examples

> There is a video widget in this course that you will use to record yourself answering certain questions. The Educative video widget is a private-use widget that does not store your data or image. You can playback a maximum of three recordings, all of which will be saved locally on your device. Once you record a fourth video, the widget will replace the first one in the queue, and so on.

Now you might be thinking, “Why can’t I just be myself?” We’ll address that in the next lesson!

# Authenticity

In this lesson, we'll explore the idea that you can be prepared for a behavioral interview without being phony.

Be genuine

Some candidates are concerned that practicing responses for behavioral interview questions will make them sound rehearsed, or that too much preparation will lead to telling the interviewer what they want to hear – ***but that’s neither true nor the intent of this course.*** Be genuine, be honest, be authentic. No one wins when you fake who you are; you’ll end up in an organization that is not the right fit, and your employer will end up with an employee who is unhappy and checked-out.

## Communicate who you are in the organization’s language [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/3YlB29JmYzx#communicate-who-you-are-in-the-organizations-language)

“Why would I need to prepare if it’s important to be authentic? What’s wrong with the “real” me?”

First off, nothing is wrong with you. What often messes people up is a lack of understanding of *how* to communicate who they are. One of the ways to communicate is to notice the company lingo.

- What are their taglines?
- How do they describe their brand?
- Are the sentences on their website short and concise or verbose and detailed?
- Do they call their employees “employees,” or do they use another noun?
- How do they describe their customers?

You wouldn’t use the same phrases or slang with your grandparents that you use with your friends and expect them to have the same understanding --would you?

For example, imagine that you’re interviewing for a role with GitHub. We know that GitHub is a company committed to community building and opensource sharing. They call their employees “Hubbers.” While responding to questions, you can use words like, “open” and “sharing,” and discuss your experiences building communities.

By using the words that they use, you will increase their understanding of who you are and what your values are. It will be a good test for both you and the interviewer to determine if the organization will be a fit.

Try each company’s lingo on for size, practice being a part of their culture, wear something or carry an accessory that is the color of their brand to the interview; this shows awareness and savvy. Notice how quickly you adopt or resist the language. Make this part of your evaluation of the opportunity; it may just save you from accepting a job you won’t enjoy.

## On sounding ‘rehearsed’ [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/3YlB29JmYzx#on-sounding-rehearsed)

If you are worried that practicing might leave you sounding rehearsed, that’s ok. Chances are that what sounds “rehearsed” to you is actually just the sound of you completely **owning** the interview.

However, you can always say something like, “I just heard my own response, and it sounds a bit rehearsed. I really prepared for this interview because it is important to me. You can count on my answers being genuine, even if they are practiced." This way, you will be able to put your mind at ease while also proving to the interviewer that you are very serious about the role.

It’s authentic for you to present your best self and show enthusiasm for the company. Maybe you aren’t sure that you are interested in the role and are just interviewing to get the practice. Even then, you can still be authentic in wanting to do well and open to discovering your true interests. No matter what, always make room for gratitude and an appreciation for the opportunity to be considered. You never know, you might fall in love with the job along the way.

In the next lesson, we’ll explore how and why **everyone** you meet during the interview process is an interviewer.

# Everyone is an Interviewer

In this lesson, we'll explore why it is important that you treat everyone at the organization like an interviewer.

**Use good manners!** Being polite is consistent with being polished and professional. Elevate your speech to include regular use of **please**, **thank you**, **you’re welcome**, and **excuse me**. Say **yes** instead of **yeah**.

When someone asks, **How are you?**, reply with good eye contact, a smile, and a positive statement. Ask them how they are in return and make it genuine. If you know you have room for improvement here, ask someone in your life to help you practice this in advance of interviewing. Give them permission to tell you when you forget to say **please** and **thank you**. Don’t forget to thank them when they remind you!

Anyone can have a say on your cultural fit

Remember, everyone you encounter, by phone or in-person, could be evaluating you as a candidate. This is especially true when an organization is looking at how well you fit into their culture.

When a decision is being made, you never know which interaction will tip the scales; anyone from recruiters to parking attendants could impact whether or not you’re hired.

Simply put, **be KIND to everyone**. Anyone in the organization can observe something you say or do and form an impression about how you would fit in. If the impression is compelling enough (no matter if it’s good or bad), they will find a way to share it with the hiring team.

In the next lesson, we’ll study the purpose of behavioral interviews.

# The Purpose of Behavioral Interviews

In this lesson, we'll look at why organizations conduct behavioral interviews.

## Past behavior is a predictor of future behavior [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/mEjNy34AkWr#past-behavior-is-a-predictor-of-future-behavior)

When preparing for interviews, it is very common for people to gloss over the behavioral portion and just focus on fine-tuning their applicable knowledge. However, interviewers also want to know if you are someone they would want to work with. They may be wondering:

- Are you calm under pressure?
- Are you comfortable giving formal presentations?
- Can you respectfully give your boss bad news?

Behavioral interviews help employers to understand how you have performed and behaved in the past in both positive and negative situations. According to [PH.D. Katherine Hansen](https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/how-to-nail-a-behavioral-interview), “behavioral interview questions are said to be 55 percent predictive of future on-the-job behavior.”

This is because traditional interviews focus on technical questions that you may have spent time studying on [codinginterview.com](http://codinginterview.com/) or a similar website. While acing the traditional interview is **extremely** important, it gives no insight into how you handle stress, failure, or conflict. That’s why behavioral interviews exist; to make sure that you’re not the kind of person who will get overwhelmed with the job in three months and cause an unnecessary commotion.

One interview method is not necessarily better than the other; however, when the methods are combined, the interview process becomes more indicative of each candidate’s true potential. With a mix of behavioral and technical questions, candidates have more opportunity to provide concrete examples of their strengths.

## What interviewers are really assessing [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/mEjNy34AkWr#what-interviewers-are-really-assessing)

So, what are interviewers really assessing during behavioral interviews? Depending on the job, it may be your ability to work in teams and collaborate with others. The culture may value knowledge sharing or being a good motivator. They might prioritize self-awareness, growth mindset, ambition, humility, comfort with ambiguity, or risk tolerance.

Whether you will be pioneering a new role or backfilling an existing one, the interviewer knows more about the job than you do. They also know more about the existing team and organization. Therefore, they may be listening for certain capabilities and behaviors that will be more likely to make a new hire successful.

In other words, the interviewer is trying to learn about all the parts of you that are usually hidden from employers until they are revealed as a problem or a virtue. Behavioral interviews ensure that employers have as much information as possible when making hiring decisions.
