# Introducing Yourself

In this lesson, we'll learn that most interviews have a pattern.

This portion of the course will be taught by [Emma Bostian](https://dev.to/emmawedekind/decoding-the-front-end-interview-process-14dl), a software engineer who has worked at IBM and now works at LogMeIn.

## Interviewing is difficult! [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/JQAm5OW5M6v#interviewing-is-difficult)

I’ve had many front-end job interviews. In fact, interviewing is a skill that most people take for granted, and front-end development interviews are some of the most difficult interviews out there.

They require you to conceptually understand the languages you work with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), code on-the-spot (eek), leverage sorting and searching algorithms from Computer Science (bubble sort, merge sort, binary search, etc.), and have an understanding of many related technologies and areas such as HTTPS, REST, and Software Development Methodologies like Agile.

## There *is* a pattern though [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/JQAm5OW5M6v#there-is-a-pattern-though)

In my experience, while interviewing for jobs all over the United States, as well as Germany, this is the general interview process for most companies:

# Cultural Interview

In this lesson, we'll learn about the cultural interview.

The cultural interview is often a candidate’s first impression within a organization, so don’t take these interviews lightly. Although, typically, cultural interviews aren’t as terrifying as coding interviews, interviewers can make or break your application.

Most likely this interview will be run by a recruiter. They may, or may not, have development experience, but they should be able to have an intelligent conversation about front-end technologies.

It’s important to truly impress your recruiter because their opinion could have a massive impact on your application. If you make it to the second or third round of interviews, and the organization is “on-the-fence” about pushing you through, the recruiter might be your biggest advocate. So be sure to impress.

Typically, cultural interviews start with “So tell me about yourself.” It’s imperative to have a well-thought out response to this question. Let’s examine two responses:

![image-20210701181207466](/Users/zhengwenxuan/Desktop/Grokking-Series/Grokking the Behavioral Interview/image-20210701181207466.png)

You can see that Max was clearly unprepared for this question and doesn’t seem like the type of person who, when put on the spot, can eloquently handle the situation. With Paige, however, she is much more well-spoken. Not only was she able to succinctly sum up her experience, but her responses elicited emotion and pride in regards to her previous roles. Plus, throwing in a line or two about her hobbies gives insight into the type of person she is.

We’ll learn about phone interviews next! Stay tuned.

# Phone interviews

In this lesson, we'll introduce some types of phone interviews.

Now, let’s go over some techniques that will help you ace your phone interviews, in-person interviews, and video-conference interviews.

For most organizations, phone interviews are required before you even get a chance to sit across from an interviewer.

According to [Jorg Stegemann](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2014/05/27/how-to-ace-a-phone-interview/#4a1613382617) (a headhunter with Kennedy Executive Search & Outplacement in Paris), “In a typical search assignment with 100 or more candidates, I identify the 15 that interest me most and call them. Based on my impressions during telephone screening interviews, I meet with five or seven of these people. Only three of them make the shortlist that I present to my client.”

So, yeah, phone interviews are ***pretty important***, but don’t be scared; we’ve got you.

For starters, there are two types of phone interviews: scheduled and unscheduled.

## Scheduled phone interviews [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xlxEyApjVjE#scheduled-phone-interviews)

Scheduled phone interviews are (obviously) scheduled on either LinkedIn or by email. If you are responding to a request to schedule **make sure that the time you are agreeing to actually works for you!** It is very important that you are not caught off guard by an appointment you accidentally made at an inconvenient time; remember, this interview will most likely determine whether or not the organization wants to move ahead with you.

## Unscheduled phone interviews [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xlxEyApjVjE#unscheduled-phone-interviews)

The second type of phone interview is unscheduled and they are… unscheduled. However, this does not mean that you have to do the interview when they call. If it’s a bad time, tell them so by saying something like, “Great to hear from you. I am not at my desk and won’t be able to give this call the attention it deserves. When can I call you back?” ([Stegemann](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2014/05/27/how-to-ace-a-phone-interview/#4a1613382617)). Do not feel uncomfortable saying this, it shows a commitment to professionalism.

> **Pro Tip**: No matter what happens during a phone interview, **you must always remain calm and courteous.** Even if you are not interested in a particular job, a snide remark could hurt your chances there and elsewhere. Remember, you do not live in a vacuum, people talk!

------

Now, how do you actually succeed at a phone interview? Let’s look at that in the next lesson!

# Techniques for phone interviews

In this lesson, we'll look at three steps to a successful phone interview.

## Study up [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/mE2J0y7V5xA#study-up)

Just like any other interview, it is important to know as much as you can about the organization that is interviewing you.

According to Jorg Stegemann, you should expect to be asked what you know about the organization; “if you are not able to state the organization’s key figures, strategy, and markets, the interview might be over after only three minutes.” ([Stegemann](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2014/05/27/how-to-ace-a-phone-interview/#4a1613382617)).

This is no reason to panic! Remember, the interviewer cannot see you, so feel free to employ a cheat sheet or search engine to help you answer.

## Be comfortable [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/mE2J0y7V5xA#be-comfortable)

Interviews are stressful enough on their own so be sure to make yourself as comfortable as possible to decrease any additional stress. Since the interview is over the phone, you will have more of an ability to control your surroundings than you would in even a video conference interview. So, please, ***take advantage of that!***

Listen and then talk

While on the call, make sure that you listen to the interviewer first and then, and only then, talk. In most cases, the interviewer will set the stage and go over some background information. Make sure that you are taking notes on these points, you will want to respond to them later.

In any interview, it is extremely important to find commonalities between you and the interviewer and the organization-- make a human connection, you will be more successful if you do. Once they are finished talking, it is your time to shine.

In order to capitalize on the time you have to talk, make sure that:

- You are hydrated to avoid throat clearing.
- You have good posture. Posture affects your voice, believe it or not.
- You are smiling which also affects your voice. Don’t believe us? Record yourself and compare.
- You end on a good note. For example, “Thanks for the call. I like what I heard and from this information, I am confident I could fill the role. I am very interested in this job and would be pleased to meet you in person. What is the next step?” ([Stegemann](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2014/05/27/how-to-ace-a-phone-interview/#4a1613382617)).

## Following up [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/mE2J0y7V5xA#following-up)

Once the phone interview is done, make sure that you follow up with a thank-you note after half a business day. This note should be short and restate your interest, your confidence that you can do the job, and a question about next steps. If you do not get a response after a week, send another. If you still don’t get a response, send a third note in three week’s time. If there’s still no response, move on-- you weren’t a good fit.

> **Pro Tip**: If you are given the opportunity to choose a time slot for the interviewer to call you…**take it!** Choose a time in the morning if you can; interviewers are human too, and humans tend to get tired as the day goes on, so make sure that you talk to them while they’re fresh!

------

Next, we’ll study body language.

# Body Language

In this lesson, we'll study body language hacks that will help you ace an interview.

No matter what you say, or how you say it, your body can always give you away. Fortunately, our bodies are hackable. Read the list below and practice each action as you read.

## Posture [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/x14gW3NDwoP#posture)

**Have good posture.** This is an automatic signal of assurance and confidence. If you normally have bad posture, pretend that a string is pulling you up to the ceiling by the crown of your head. This works sitting or standing.

## Eye contact [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/x14gW3NDwoP#eye-contact)

**Look at the interviewer’s face, not just their eyes.** While it is a belief that one should look directly into another’s eyes whilst talking, this can be unnerving for both you and the interviewer. In order to avoid this, try looking at a different part of the interviewer’s face every 2-4 seconds. This will keep you looking engaged and is significantly better than just glaring your eyeballs into theirs.

## Hand gestures [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/x14gW3NDwoP#hand-gestures)

**Speak with your hands if you are unsure of what to do with them.** It is human nature to hide your hands when you’re feeling nervous; however, doing so can communicate to the interviewer that you are hiding something. Even though the only thing you are hiding from them is probably your nervousness, such behavior can stand out and is best when avoided.

Think about the last time you watched the news, were the newscaster’s hands under the desk or clasped up on the desk? Most likely, their hands were above the desk because, on a biological level, it is much easier to trust someone you do not know if you can see that they’re not hiding something.

So, if you find yourself hiding your hands, use hand gestures as you talk – it will make it easier for the interviewer to trust you. On the other hand, if you have been told that you move your hands **too much** when you are talking, try clasping them together in front of you.

## Walk [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/x14gW3NDwoP#walk)

**Work on your walk.** When walking to meet an interviewer make sure that you’re walking directly toward them with every body part facing in their direction. Such body position shows you to be confident and ready to face challenges head on.

------

In the next lesson, we’ll look at a few more body language hacks!

# Body Language Techniques

In this lesson, we'll study a few other body language techniques.

## Open body language [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7DM8AAVW1Nr#open-body-language)

**Open your body up.** Humans have a tendency to cross their arms and/or legs when they are feeling nervous or need protection. Go ahead and cross your arms and/or your legs. Do you feel shielded and safe? If you do, that’s great, but you do not want the interviewer to feel as if they are on the other side of a shield.

As soon as you sit down for an interview, automatically take a mental note of where your arms and legs are. Uncross your arms and legs if they’re crossed. If being so “unprotected” freaks you out, it is perfectly fine to cross your ankles as this will give you a feeling of protection without cutting the interviewer out.

## Leaning in [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7DM8AAVW1Nr#leaning-in)

**Lean-in to the conversation.** Humans naturally “lean-in” to conversations that they are invested in. Next time you go to a restaurant, look at the body language of couples, those who seem to be having the best time will be leaning close to one another, while those who seem to be disconnected will be sitting back. So, try “leaning” into the interview and see what happens.

## Mirroring [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7DM8AAVW1Nr#mirroring)

**Mirror your interviewer.** Mirroring is a natural thing that humans do when they are “vibing” with one another. Although it is not advised to start mirroring as soon as the interview starts, it is a good thing to do once a rapport has been established as it reinforces your human connection.

What does this mean? It means that if the interviewer crosses their arms, you cross yours. If they cross their legs, you cross your legs too. However, it is important that you do not mimic the interviewer’s movement too quickly afterward; you do not want them to think that you are copying them.

------

That’s it on body language! In the next lesson, we’ll look at some techniques for video conference interviews.

# Video Conference Interviews

In this lesson, we'll start learning about video conference interviews.

## Introduction [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/m2nAzppNRE3#introduction)

Now that you’ve mastered how to act in an in-person interview, it’s time to forget everything and learn how to act in a video conference interview. Well, no, not everything, not even close; but you do need to commit a few more things to memory before embarking on one of these interviews.

The most important thing to remember in such an interview is that you need to be visible and audible – the interviewer needs to leave the video conference with a strong impression of what you look like and sound like in real life. You DO NOT want to be known as the washed-out person with a crackly voice. In this course, you will have opportunities to practice on video. While reviewing your responses, view at least once with the sound off to assess your body language. The six guidelines below will be helpful when embarking on a video conference interview.

## Camera angle [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/m2nAzppNRE3#camera-angle)

Be wary of an unflattering camera angle. Unlike person-to-person interviews, your camera may not show you as you really are. Before getting on a call, check how your camera is looking at you. One of the easiest ways to do this is to pull up the video-calling app (most have picture previews) and adjust the camera pre-interview.

While adjusting, be wary of camera angles that are so low that they give the interviewer a look into your nose or camera angles that are so high that the interviewer is looking down on you. The correct placement for a camera should be right at eye level; however, you must remember to look directly at the camera. If you are looking at the computer screen, it will appear as if you are looking down, which is not a good look.

> **Pro Tip**: Grab some big books and rest your laptop on them in front of you. This will bring the camera to eye-level.

## Lighting [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/m2nAzppNRE3#lighting)

Make sure you’re visible. As anyone who has tried to take a selfie knows, getting lighting right can be tricky.

The biggest problem most people have with lighting in video conferences is the “too much light in the background” issue. Too much light can make someone look washed out and hard to look at. To fix this problem, try reducing the amount of light behind you; if that makes things too dark, find a lamp with an adjustable neck that you can place nearby to cast light on your face. If this light is too bright, adjust it.

## Clean background [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/m2nAzppNRE3#clean-background)

Clean your area. One of the biggest differences between an in-person interview and a video conference interview is that you control your surroundings. For the most part, this is a positive but, depending on the background you choose, it can also be a negative.

To avoid any awkward moments, make sure that your background is clean. The easiest way to make sure an interviewer will not be greeted with any surprises is to find a solid-colored wall to sit in front of; nothing ruins an otherwise good interview like your half-naked roommate sitting in the living room behind you. Do what you can to minimize anything distracting that might occur in the view.

# Techniques for Video Conference Interviews

In this lesson, we'll look at some more techniques for video conference interviews.

## Simplify your look [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/JP2y8ONAJ7g#simplify-your-look)

In-person, patterned clothing can be a great way to individualize yourself but, on camera, patterns can be distracting and (potentially) blinding. Therefore, it is best to be outfitted in a solid colored shirt with minimal jewelry. Remember, this interview is about your skills, not your style; there’s no benefit to distracting your interviewer.

> **Pro Tip**: Blue is the best color to wear on camera.

## Be presentable [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/JP2y8ONAJ7g#be-presentable)

This rule is arguably the most important one in this list – you do not want to be caught on camera unawares. Luckily, most cameras have a preview functionality so you should easily be able to see if you are on camera. However, if you are worried, just put a sticky note over your computer’s camera until you’re ready. After all, you can never be too prepared!

## Clarify your audio [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/JP2y8ONAJ7g#clarify-your-audio)

Last, but not least, is your audio quality. Your interviewer needs to hear what you’re saying or else what is the point? If you are unsure of the quality of your audio, call a friend and talk to them, see what they think. If you recognize that you have bad audio an easy fix is to get a headset, which will clarify your voice and diminish any outside noise.

Additionally, try and drink a glass of water before you start; making sure that you’re hydrated will keep your voice smooth and decrease your chances of having to get up to get water in the middle of the interview.

> **Remember**: Speak slower over devices than you would in person. Digital devices sometimes have a lag. Anytime there is something between you and another person, compensate by speaking slower.

# Not an exact match? No problem!

In this lesson, we'll look at a few techniques you can employ when you don't have the right experience for a position.

## You don’t have to be ‘qualified’ to get the job [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xooKkQpxr5P#you-dont-have-to-be-qualified-to-get-the-job)

So, you’ve run across a job that you don’t have enough experience for – you have two options in this situation. You can either be intimidated by the job and forget about it or you can go after it anyway. We will be dealing with the second option in this course because, believe it or not, *it is still possible to get a job that you are not qualified for on paper*.

According to [Rebecca Zucker](https://hbrascend.org/topics/how-to-ace-the-interview-when-you-dont-have-a-lot-or-the-right-type-of-experience/?utm_source=LinkedIn_website&medium=website_share%2F), “whether you are just starting your career or looking to make a career change, you should anticipate questions about your relevant experience – or lack thereof.” In her article, “How to Ace the Interview When You Don’t Have the Right Type of Experience,” Zucker goes over six strategies that you can use to improve your chances of getting a job that requires experiences you do not have. We have chosen to elaborate on two of these.

## Develop rapport [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xooKkQpxr5P#develop-rapport)

Develop an easy rapport with the interviewer. The easiest way to present yourself as likable is by making a real connection with your interviewer.

In fact, according to [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/23/the-scientific-reason-being-likable-will-get-you-hired-and-self-promotion-wont.html), “candidates who focus on ingratiation, or who are likable, have a better chance of being hired.” In interviews, most hiring managers conduct the airport test; i.e., “Would I want to spend 6 hours with this person in a random airport if a flight got canceled?” If the answer is no, then they probably won’t want to work with you either.

How do you become likable? The honest answer is that you research your interviewer. You find them on Linkedin and highlight common likes and dislikes; anything that you can find that will connect you to them is important. For most people, all it takes is a few commonalities to get that “likable-ball” rollin!

## [“Yes, and”](https://hbrascend.org/topics/how-to-ace-the-interview-when-you-dont-have-a-lot-or-the-right-type-of-experience/?utm_source=LinkedIn_website&medium=website_share%2F) [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/xooKkQpxr5P#yes-and)

It is extremely important that you never get defensive about your lack of experience or try to minimize it. Instead, employ the “Yes, and” technique as a way to lessen your interviewer’s fears.

One example given by Zucker is to say, “Yes, I know there are other candidates with more experience in this field, and noticed in the job description that you are also looking for someone who can take initiative with little direction. Let me give you some examples of where I’ve done this, directly contributing to the success of my team at…” This response will answer the interviewer’s questions while simultaneously showcasing your directly-applicable abilities.

> **Pro Tip**: Job descriptions are sometimes posted with “aspirational” qualifications. That is, the hiring team will list every possible attribute that they would ideally want in a candidate, but they don’t expect that someone will have 100% of them. Many times, they are just casting a “wide net” to get a larger candidate pool. They may intend to hire for potential.

------

The next lesson is about how to deal with rejection.

# On Being Rejected

In this lesson, we'll look at a few things to keep in mind when dealing with rejection.

Learning from rejection

Rejection, is something that has happened to anyone who has ever applied for jobs. Sometimes, it is obvious that you’re going to get rejected, and sometimes it is not.

However, rejection is not something to get down about – it is only an indication that a job was not worthy of **you**. The most important thing to take away from a rejection is Do’s and Don’ts. Everyone’s Do’s and Don’ts will be different, and it is critical that you find yours. When you find yourself rejected, remember…

This is an opportunity for growth

You know you got rejected for a reason and it is your job to find out what that reason was. If you have the chance, ask the recruiter what indicated to them that you were not right for the job – there is no shame in asking and they may even respect you more for it. If, after asking this question, you get a response that doesn’t make sense to you and, in fact, seems like a *lie* – **Don’t dwell on it**. Sometimes, you won’t get a straight answer as to why you were rejected or even the right one. Why? Because sometimes an interviewer is having a bad day and you annoyed them, sometimes a company will have already decided on who they want and you were just unlucky enough to come in after them, and sometimes it will be even more arbitrary than that. The point is that ***sometimes rejections don’t make any sense at all.***

If you don’t get feedback from the recruiter, do a self-assessment.

- Review any queues you detected that you did not respond to an answer correctly.
- Was there anything that you missed while doing your homework?
- What would you like to practice more?

> **Pro Tip**: Put yourself in your interviewer/recruiters shoes. Yes, the reason for your rejection may be phony, but it may be an attempt to maintain a relationship (if they have you in mind for another role)or let you down as easy as they possibly can. No matter the reason, it’s about THEM not YOU.

## This job is not the only job in existence [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7XqvK3NRv8G#this-job-is-not-the-only-job-in-existence)

After a rejection, quickly get back on that horse and find another opportunity. Since there are so many organizations looking for new talent, it is a good idea to be interviewing at multiple places at the same time; this way, one rejection won’t feel so devastating.

## Never, ever, ever, personalize your rejection [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7XqvK3NRv8G#never-ever-ever-personalize-your-rejection)

Yes, the organization directly rejected you, but they also didn’t. There could be a variety of reasons you didn’t receive an offer (maybe they decided not to fill the job). For them, you were someone who was going to fill a role that they needed filled, not someone who they were looking to hangout with; so, it really wasn’t about you, it was about your skills. The good news is that, unlike your personality, skills are something you can grow and add to.

## Rejection is normal [#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-behavioral-interview/7XqvK3NRv8G#rejection-is-normal)

According to career coach and author [Orville Pierson](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-career-coach-job-rejection-20170317-story.html), “The average job seeker is rejected by 24 decision-makers before they get the yes”.

“You want to be extra rigorous about making the best possible thing you can. Find everything that’s wrong with it and fix it. Seek negative feedback, particularly from friends.” – Elon Musk

“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So, you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” – Steve Jobs

> **Pro Tip**: Every failure is *actually* a learning experience in disguise.

------

That’s it for the theoretical part of this course! Let’s look at a quick conclusion and some tests in the upcoming chapter.
